# Symphonia

## Summary 
Project made under the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google. 
This project is a music player application that shows songs, artists, albums, and playlists.
The app also has a shuffle button on the main page and the music player controls is at the bottom.
The app only plays one song due to my inexperience with getting it to work by scanning the phone and playing the mp3 files it finds.

### To Do

Make this into an actual music player
 - Scan phone for media files
 - Display name of song currently playing with artist name
 - Now playing thumbnail changes to show album cover or any picture the person chose
